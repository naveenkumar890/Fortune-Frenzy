## 🧠 How It Works

* A circular wheel is divided into multiple segments.
* When the user clicks the “Spin” button, the wheel rotates with CSS transitions.
* A random segment is selected as the winning outcome.
* Corresponding sound effects play based on selection and win.
* JavaScript handles the rotation, timing, and randomization.
